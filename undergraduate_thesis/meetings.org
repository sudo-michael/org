** New ideas you’re excited about (10 min)
- what's the end goal of doing research with HJ reachability? is it to be able to solve an HJ PDE of high dimention in real time?
-

** Papers you’ve read recently that are interesting/influential/important (5 min)


** Research project(s) discussion (40 min)
*** Updates on progress
- went through cs285 lectures 1-9
*** New findings
*** New questions
- When training model, how would I represent the states and actions?
  Since the value function from optimzied_dp is an array for some grid, would I discretize everything? I thought about using a DQN but I wasn't sure how I would incorporate the value function to the weights of the DQN
- I'm still not sure how to bridge the gap between value function and RL
- How long should an episode be?

*** Action items for Mo:
* <2021-01-29 Fri>
** Not a good week, meeting
- how does safety modify what rewards we choose
- robots havebehaviour "unsure" confidience/disconfert
- make task easy, pretrain with BRT
- replace Q
- replace Q with union of HJ value
