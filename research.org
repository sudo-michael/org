#+TITLE: Research
This will be a node book for my USRA NSERC
Notes should go here

** Questions to ask:
*** what does this notation mean ζ(s;z,t,u(·),d(·))? - system trigectory
*** what is the meaning of u(·)?
*** also γ[u](·)
*** what does R^n_d mean
*** how to do you create a dynamical system?
*** BRS - backwards reachable sets
reachable at the end of the time horizon
**** maximum represents sets that are guarenteed to reach T
**** minimum represents sets that are guarenteed to reach T for all possible controlls
*** BRT - backwards reachable tubes
reachable at anytime of the time horizon

** AWS Deep Racer
*** Pro
- alsdjfalsfj
- aslfksdjl
*** Con
- Doesn't look like there's an easy way to give manual controls to it
  There's a manual mode, but it's a GUI interface
  GitHub repo that allows to control car with PS4 controller but looks hacky
** NVIDIA jet racer
*** Pro
*** Con
**** needs 3d printed jig plate
**** RC Car is hard to buy
- shipped from Japan / unavailable
**** Uses Jupter Notebooks to give inputs to car
- the backend is just sending inputs using ServoKit over some channel



* Presentation
Notes: If including math explain it
Don't go into too much detail
What I'll cover
What is HJ reachability
    Talk about brts
Compare solving it using matlab compared to python, speed up using fpgas
What I did was work on simulating things with Ros and Gazebebo

Talk about suboptimal controll
Bring up u(x) >= 0 create graph
Show demonstration
