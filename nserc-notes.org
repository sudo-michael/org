* Planning Algorithms
** x^.= f(x,u), where x^. is a velocity
* non-adapting strategy: players cannot see into the future
* Let's play a game, I have this function G(t, x) = min_{gamma in disturbance}max_{a in actions}J_t(x, a(), gamma[a]()) Disturbance wins if G(t, x) <= 0 otherwise acitions wins. This is why disturbance tries to minimize G(t,x)
