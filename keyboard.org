* DONE build keyboard [100%]
Finished: <2020-12-26 Sat>
- [X] lube stabilzers
- [X] lube switches
- [X] install stabilzers
- [X] verify layout is correct
- [X] solder
- [X] remap keys
** What to do next time
*** Good
- durock stablizers are good
- zealios are good
- 65g is good, but might be nice to be a bit lighter
- film
*** Bad
- test keys with keycaps since spacebar wouldn't go up all the way
- take more time applying lube, keyboard time >>>>> time spend lubing
- might be better to have a split keyboard instead
- lube stabilzers more and bandaid mode it
