#+TITLE: Thesis1

* Honours Thesis
** Statement
How can precomputed BRTs be used to partition objects in an unknown environment,
and to what extent could it be used to warm-start a deep RL network

* TODO Winter Break
** Q-functions
** Actor-Critic 
** 9
** Value function HJ TTR TTC
** Given obstacle compute ttr
** union of min of TTR based of poloicy
** Init V or Q function in RL
** time to reach in RL is -dt reward
** goal = sum discount*-dt
